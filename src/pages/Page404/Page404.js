            You told your friends you were not bringing your phone, to try and experience what travel was like back in
            the day.<br/>
            You bought a map and a bottle of water and carried your camera for the money shot.<br/>
            But the map was from 2005 and the landscape had changed.<br/>
            So here you are, in the middle of a large field, that the map continues to claim is a local grocer.
